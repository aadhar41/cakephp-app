Adding cake to your system path
If you are on a *nix system (linux, MacOSX) the following steps will let you add the cake executable to your system path.

1. Locate where your CakePHP install, and cake executable are. For example /Users/mark/cakephp/lib/Cake/Console/cake

2. Edit your .bashrc or .bash_profile file in your home directory, and add the following: 

export PATH="$PATH:/Users/mark/cakephp/lib/Cake/Console"

Note (Aadhar) : I edited the .bashrc and .bash_profile at the location - (/home/ubuntu) and added the above export PATH to it

3. Reload the bash configuration or open a new terminal, and cake should work anywhere.

I also have this problem on some servers and never figured out why this happened. I suspect the so called "shebang" might not be set correctly for every Linux distribution (e.g. if the cake script stars with #!/usr/bin/env bash, but you don't use bash on your server or your distribution doesn't have the env binary in that path, it might fail on that. This is just a theory though, as I said I never really figured it out, nor did I invest much time in investigating.

Although, what I always use as a fallback is simply calling the cake.php script (from the app folder) instead, like:

php Console/cake.php -app `pwd` bake

That never lets me down. The -app pwd bit is to tell the shell that your current directory is your app directory, so the shell can find all your files.
